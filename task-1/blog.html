          Front-end developers create user interfaces (UI). UI is the graphical
          layout of an application that determines what each part of a site or
          application does and how it will look. "I've always found crafting
          polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the
          most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software
          engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye
          for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."
